This is an example C++ project that uses LoRANN to index the MNIST data set with uint8 data.

Run `make prepare-data` to download the data.

Run `make` to build the executable and run it using `./example`.

Note that you can change the template arguments to index data with different data types.

The full C++ documentation is available [here](https://ejaasaari.github.io/lorann/cpp.html).
